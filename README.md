# Pawdew Updater

The Pawdew Updater is a simple to use installer for Stardew Valley modpacks. Currently work in progress.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add custom modpack URLs
- [ ] Save all used modpacks to switch between
- [ ] A better way to find where Stardew may be since `libraryfolders.vdf` tends to be out of date until Steam restarts.
- [ ] A better README
- [ ] Switch out TUI with GUI
